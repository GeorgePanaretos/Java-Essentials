## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

To start using Java-Essentials in your project, follow these simple steps:

1. Add the Java-Essentials dependency to your project's `pom.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.example</groupId>
       <artifactId>java-essentials</artifactId>
       <version>1.0.0</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. Import the necessary classes into your Java files:

   ```java
   import com.example.javaessentials.StringUtils;
   import com.example.javaessentials.DateUtils;
   import com.example.javaessentials.MathUtils;
   import com.example.javaessentials.SecurityUtils;
   // ... add other imports as needed
   ```

3. Start using the Java-Essentials functions and classes in your code:

   ```java
   String modifiedString = StringUtils.reverse("Hello, World!");
   System.out.println(modifiedString);  // Output: "!dlroW ,olleH"

   LocalDate now = DateUtils.getCurrentDate();
   System.out.println(now);  // Output: "2023-07-02"

   double result = MathUtils.calculateSquareRoot(25);
   System.out.println(result);  // Output: 5.0

   String hashedPassword = SecurityUtils.hashPassword("myPassword123");
   System.out.println(hashedPassword);  // Output: "4b4e674dc8cc717f0e43aefe0f6ddcdc"
   ```
